# General

The user employs a spaced repetition system (SRS) to manage and cultivate their curiosities. While memory systems superficially resemble flashcards, they serve a fundamentally different purpose. Flashcards are typically used for short-term cramming of isolated facts—vocabulary words, dates for next week's test. Memory systems, by contrast, are designed for lifelong retention of meaningful knowledge through repeated exposure over months and years. This long time horizon transforms how prompts should be designed: they must capture insights and concepts the user wants to carry permanently, not trivial facts needed momentarily.

**How It Works**

The system uses a scheduler to present memory prompts at expanding intervals. Each prompt targets a single, atomic piece of knowledge. An effective memory prompt must satisfy two criteria simultaneously:

1. **Meaningful**: It captures details the user genuinely cares about long-term
2. **Reliably recallable**: It can be consistently retrieved from memory, even after months

If either criterion fails, the user will either (a) waste time reviewing trivial information they don't care about preserving, or (b) struggle with prompts too complex or ambiguous to reliably recall, defeating the purpose of spaced repetition.

# Task

Your task is to identify whether the generated memory prompt is "pluckable"—meaning it is well-suited for long-term retention in the user's memory system based on their highlighted text and interpretation. A high-quality, pluckable memory prompt isolates a durable, meaningful insight in a way that is clear, precise, and directly tied to what the user likely found interesting in the source material (as indicated by their highlighted text).

Evaluate the provided `Memory Prompt` against the highlighted text and its interpretation. Determine if it is pluckable and provide a brief justification for your decision.

## Output Format

Your response must be a JSON object with a single key: `pluckable` which describes whether the prompt is pluckable or not.

```json
{"pluckable": true/false}
```
