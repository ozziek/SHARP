The user uses a spaced repetition system (SRS) to build lasting knowledge rather than cram short-term facts. Prompts reappear at expanding intervals and must be both meaningful and easy to recall—otherwise, they waste effort or fail to reinforce memory.

Determine if the generated memory prompt is **pluckable**—i.e., suitable for long-term retention based on the user’s highlight and interpretation.

**Output:**
Return a JSON object:

```json
{"pluckable": true/false}
```
